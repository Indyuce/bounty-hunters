BountyHunters is an open source project and aims at providing an all-in-one bounty solution for spigot servers. If you would like to contribute to the project, you can buy the paid version over Spigot for 9€ however a free version is available over Spigot as well. This repository corresponds to the latest **premium build**, that means you are also free to edit and compile the plugin on your end.

Bug reports and feature suggestions keep the project alive too!
