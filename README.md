**Please open a ticket if you need help with anything related to the plugin, I usually do not follow the plugin discussion.** The wiki presents the main plugin features as well as the main API methods and classes, don't hesitate to have a look before opening an issue to make sure it does not have the answer you're looking for.

BountyHunters is an open source project and aims at providing an all-in-one bounty solution for spigot servers. If you would like to contribute to the project, you can buy the paid version over Spigot for 9â‚¬ however a free version is available over Spigot as well. This repository corresponds to the latest **premium build**, that means you are also free to edit and compile the plugin on your end.
